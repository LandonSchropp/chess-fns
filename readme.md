# ♟️  Chess Functions ♟️ 

This library is a collection of ✨ [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) ✨
for manipulating [Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fen) strings and
other chess data structures. It's written in [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/).

⚠️  This library is a work in progress! It's not ready for use yet. ⚠️ 

## Usage

TODO: Fill out this section once the library is deployed.

## Inspiration

This library is inspired by many other wonderful open source projects.

* [Chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md) is a fantastic
  object-oriented chess library. Much of the implementation and many of the test cases in this
  library were directly inspired from Chess.js.
* [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page): This project is an
  invaluable resource for anyone who would like to try their hand at chess programming. It features
  invaluable guidance on many different subjects the helps to shape this library.

## Development

This project is written using [Bun](https://bun.sh/). While you don't need bun to _use_ the library,
it is necessary for development.

This library ships with several helpful commands for development.

* `bun install`: Install dependencies.
* `bun build`: Compile the project to the `dist` folder.
* `bun check-types`: Ensure all of the types are correct.
* `bun test`: Run all of the tests.
* `bun lint`: Run the linter.
