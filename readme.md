# ♟️  Functional Chess ♟️ 

A collection of ✨ [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) ✨ for manipulating
[Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fen) strings and other chess data
structures. Written in [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/).

## Chess.js

[Chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md) is a fantastic chess library.
This library is built on top of Chess.js. It's primary intention is to provide a functional
interface for chess data structures.
